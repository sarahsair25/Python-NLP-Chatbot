🤖 Python NLP Chatbot

A simple yet effective rule-based chatbot built using Python and NLTK.
This project demonstrates the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by enabling conversational interactions through pattern matching and predefined responses.

📌 Project Overview

This chatbot uses NLTK’s Chat utility to simulate human-like conversations. It recognizes user input using regular expression patterns and responds with predefined replies. The project is designed as a beginner-friendly NLP application and serves as a strong foundation for more advanced AI chatbots.
